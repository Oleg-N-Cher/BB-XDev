XDev
====
XDev is open and free environment (set of compilers, additional tools,
libraries and design patterns) for cross-platform and embedded development
in modular programming languages Oberon-2 and Component Pascal.

You can develop projects in several languages at once.
You can develop for different platforms, such as retro and new.

XDev/ZXDev
==========
ZXDev is a XDev subsystem for target platform Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K.

Documentation: ZXDev/Docu
Forum: http://zx.oberon2.ru/forum/viewforum.php?f=10


XDev/WinDev
===========
WinDev is a XDev subsystem for target platform Microsoft Windows (32/64 bit).


Supported languages, platforms and translations schemes
=======================================================

Oberon, Oberon-2 =>[Ofront]=> C =>[SDCC]=> ZX Spectrum TRD (TR-DOS image)
C =>[SDCC]=> ZX Spectrum TRD (TR-DOS image)
Z80 assembly =>[SDCC]=> ZX Spectrum TRD (TR-DOS image)

Oberon, Oberon-2, Component Pascal => BlackBox => Win32 native machine code
(EXE, DLL)

Oberon, Oberon-2, Component Pascal => BlackBox => Linux i386 native machine code
(SO)


Now I'm working on adding to support the platform J2ME.

To reduce the significance of the development environment, as well as
difference of dialects, the cross-platform libraries would be all the same
common for different platforms and different languages.

I'm sorry, but mainly project documentation is in Russian. I hope, if you
really interested in this project, it's will not be a problem. You can read it
with help of multi-language Google translator.

I am interested in supporting other platforms in various ways, in adding
new libraries, tools and compilers for these platforms.


Main goals and benefits of XDev
===============================
+ Simplicity,
+ Reliability,
+ Small size of the target machine code,
+ The widely using of the great achievements of the European school
  of programming, such as safe and modular programming languages -
  Oberon, Oberon-2, Component Pascal.
