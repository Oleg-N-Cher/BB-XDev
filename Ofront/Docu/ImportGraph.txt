ImportGraph is an application to be used in conjunction with the freeware
GraphVis package (www.graphviz.org). ImportGraph parses a list of modules from
the command line and outputs a GraphVis document depicting the import
hierarchy. The document is sent to the stdout and can be redirected to a file.

To avoid visual clutter the following node legend is used:
 - red text: module imports SYSTEM;
 - square: module imports Windows;
 - no shape: ModuleName.ob2 not found (typically XDS libraries);
 - ellipse: other modules.

For example, the following batch code:
ImportGraph.exe ImportGraph > graph.dot
"c:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin\dot" -Tpng graph.dot > graph.png

Produces graph.png image depicting the modules used by ImportGraph.

For use with BlackBox the program must be executed in the BlackBox root folder.
Example:
"c:\Program Files\BlackBox\ImportGraph.exe" HostMenus > graph.dot
