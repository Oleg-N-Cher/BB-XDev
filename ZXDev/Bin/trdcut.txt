TRDCUT v1.1
-----------

 This little utility cuts the huge 655360 bytes long TRD files, leaving them
with their appropiate size. The part of the file that gets cutted are just
filling zeroes, that contain no useful info.

 This program works under both Windows and DOS. Windows LFN (Long FileNames)
are supported.

 It's a command line program, and it cuts all TRD files in current directory
to their minimum size. No operands are needed. Copy it to a directory in
your path (usually C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND or C:\DOS if you're not using Windows),
and then type TRDCUT in the directory where your big TRD files are located.

 If you're a Windows user who doesn't like DOS boxes or typing orders,
another way of using this would be: copy the program TRDCUT.COM into the
folder with the TRD files you want to cut and execute it. Then close the
DOS-box with the messages.

 If there's any TRD file with the read-only attribute, the program will
exit with a "Can't erase file" message. To prevent this, remove that
attribute with "attrib -r" from command line or from the Properties
window.

 TRDCUT is Freeware. Feel free to email me with bug-reports, suggestions to
improve it or if you want the source code.
